      { type: "paragraph", text: "Full-stack development is one of the highest-paying domains in the tech industry. Among various technology stacks, the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) remains the most popular choice for startups and enterprises alike due to its efficiency and use of JavaScript throughout the entire application." },
      { type: "heading", text: "Why Choose MERN Stack?" },
      { type: "paragraph", text: "The biggest advantage of MERN is that you only need to master one language: JavaScript. From the client-side interface to server-side logic and database queries, everything is handled using JS/JSON. This unifies the development process and makes debugging significantly easier." },
      { type: "heading", text: "1. Front-End: Mastering React.js" },
      { type: "paragraph", text: "React is the library of choice for building dynamic user interfaces. To master it, you need to understand Components, State Management (Redux or Context API), and Hooks. In 2025, knowing Next.js (a React framework) is also becoming crucial for SEO-friendly server-side rendering." },
      { type: "heading", text: "2. Back-End: Node.js and Express" },
      { type: "paragraph", text: "Node.js allows JavaScript to run on the server. Paired with Express.js, a minimal framework, you can build robust APIs quickly. You will need to learn about RESTful APIs, authentication (JWT), and middleware integration." },
      { type: "heading", text: "3. Database: MongoDB" },
      { type: "paragraph", text: "MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents. It is highly scalable and flexible, making it perfect for modern web applications that handle large volumes of unstructured data." },
      { type: "heading", text: "Conclusion" },
      { type: "paragraph", text: "Becoming a MERN stack developer requires consistent practice. Start by building small projects like a To-Do app, then move to complex apps like E-commerce stores. The demand for full-stack developers is skyrocketing, and this path guarantees a promising career." }
